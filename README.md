### Hardware Required

1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. pH sensor with a BNC connector
3. pH sensor interface (pH sensor module)
4. Connecting wires
5. Breadboard
6. LCD display (optional, for displaying the pH value directly)

### Wiring the Components

1. Connect the pH sensor module to the Arduino:
   - VCC to 5V
   - GND to GND
   - AO (Analog Output) to A0 (Analog Pin 0)

2. If using an LCD display, connect it according to its datasheet or use an I2C LCD for easier wiring.

### Arduino Code

Here's a simple Arduino code to read the pH value from the sensor and print it to the Serial Monitor. If using an LCD, you can add the necessary code to display the value on the LCD.
alibrating the Sensor

The conversion factor `3.5` used in the code is a placeholder and should be adjusted based on the calibration of your pH sensor. Typically, you will need to perform a two-point calibration using buffer solutions (e.g., pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 solutions).

### Steps for Calibration

1. Place the pH sensor in the pH 7.0 buffer solution and note the voltage reading.
2. Place the pH sensor in the pH 4.0 buffer solution and note the voltage reading.
3. Use these readings to create a more accurate conversion formula. For example:


float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);
float pH = 7 - ((voltage - voltageAt7pH) * (3 / (voltageAt4pH - voltageAt7pH)));


Replace `voltageAt7pH` and `voltageAt4pH` with the actual voltage readings from your calibration process.

### Note

The exact connection and calibration process might vary depending on the specific pH sensor module you are using. Always refer to the datasheet and user manual for your sensor module for detailed instructions.
